Artemis is a collection of tools that make it easier to run experiments in Python. These include:

* An easy-to-use system for making live plots, to monitor variables in a running experiment.
* A browser-based plotter for displaying live plots.
* A framework for defining experiments and logging their results (text output and figures) so that they can be reviewed later and replicated easily.
* A system for downloading/caching files, to a local directory, so the same code can work on different machines.
